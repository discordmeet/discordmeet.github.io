                        You can set the following fields:

                <h1 class="title is-3">How does Joining work? / Why am I being kicked?</h1>
                <p class="content is-medium">
                Since this service uses DMs users need to open a DM channel to the bot in order to participate.
                However, Discord decided to not allow users to directly DM others without sharing a server or being friends with them.
                They also prevent Bot Accounts from using the friend system so the only option left was to have user and bot
                in one server at one point in time to allow them to establish a connection.
                Though, creating a server, adding the Bot to it, then manually opening a DM channel and writing something is very cumbersome.
                So to participate you join this special Server where the bot already resides and upon joining it automatically 
                sends you a DM and kicks you again. This server is SOLELY used to open the DM channel.
                The decision to kick users after the DM channel has been opened was made to ensure the 
                anonymity of users. Otherwise, anyone in that server could see who else is using or has used the service and as 
                it's supposed to be an <i>anonymous</i>, random chat service, this step is integral.
                This also makes for a clean and nicely integrated joining procedure.
